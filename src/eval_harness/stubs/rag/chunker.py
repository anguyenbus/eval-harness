    """
    Fixed-size text chunker for document processing.

    NOTE: This is a reference stub implementation for demonstration purposes.
    It is not intended for production use.

    The FixedChunker splits documents into deterministic, fixed-size chunks
    based on character count. This approach ensures reproducibility and
    enables precise character offset tracking for citation alignment.

    Attributes:
        _chunk_size: Number of characters per chunk (512).
        _chunk_overlap: Number of characters to overlap between chunks (0).

    Example:
        >>> chunker = FixedChunker()
        >>> chunks = chunker.chunk(doc_id="doc1", text="Hello world. " * 100)
        >>> len(chunks)

        Split a document into fixed-size chunks.

        Chunks are created by dividing the text into segments of CHUNK_SIZE
        characters. Each chunk tracks its character offsets (char_span) for
        citation alignment with gold spans.

        Args:
            doc_id: Document identifier for chunk_id generation.
            text: Full document text to chunk.
